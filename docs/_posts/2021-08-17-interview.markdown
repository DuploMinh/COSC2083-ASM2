# IT Work
Here, I have decided to interview Mr. Phan Trọng Huy. Mr. Huy is the Director of a software company that I have interned in. He is also the project manager so he could be considered an IT professional. My interview with him is as followed.

Question(Q): Thank you for agreeing to this interview. Can I ask what is your current position?

Answer(A): You are welcome. I am currently the director of Khang Vân Co LTD. We are specialized in software and specifically shipping management software. 

Q: Can you tell me what kind of work do you do day to day?

A: Well, as the director, I am responsible for a great deal of business, especially as we are a small company. I work with customers to find out what do they want the application to achieve and to plan the features that will then be sent to developer and designers to develop. I also work with the customer during the development process to receive their feedbacks and customize our application to satisfy the customer. I also supervise the deployment of the application and helps our client with some of their needs during this process such as setting up the necessary infrastructure. During the development process, I plan how the feature should be developed by managing the timetable and specify the technicalities of the features such as what should an API returns or the arrangement of a database system. 


Q: What kind of people do you have to deal with? 

A: I deal with all kinds of people. In our company, I work with my employees to coordinate business. I work with customers as I have mentioned before to develop our products. I also work with third parties such as vendors or port authority to secure the necessary cooperation that we need in the development process. For example, we work with port authorities to integrate their system into our product that we then deploy for our customer.


Q: Where do you spend most of your time?

A: My time is often divided between in the office and meeting with customers to discuss the products. 


Q: What do you find most challenging about your job?

A: I would say having to cater to customers’ requirement. This is because many of the time customers would request something that is absurd that we must talk them down or they cannot accurately describe what they want so when we deliver them the prototype, they don’t like it, so we have to change it. Customers many of the time don’t know what they want so we must work with them to deliver a product that with satisfy them.
