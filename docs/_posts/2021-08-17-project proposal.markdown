# Project proposal

## Overview:
My project is about creating a grammatical correction engine with Vietnamese texts as Grammarly has done with English. I wanted to create an engine that can correct grammar mistakes, typos, incorrect word choices and incorrect position of accents in Vietnamese texts. I intended that this service could be delivered over the Internet such as the case with Grammarly or it could be provided as a software package to run locally on a machine such as with the current service offered in Microsoft Word.

## Motivation:
I thought of this idea when I heard a friend complaining that he had to proofread papers as a part of his part-time job. I then started to wonder if there is a way to automate this time-consuming task of checking for grammatical mistakes and typos and make the job of proofreader easier as they now can focus more on the content.
