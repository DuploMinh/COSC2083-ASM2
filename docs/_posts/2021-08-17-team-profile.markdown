# Team name
I have decided to name my team” Tekno”. I chose this name as this seems to be futuristic and foreign and is seems to be related to technology.

# Team profile

[Personality Trait](https://github.com/DuploMinh/COSC2083-ASM2/blob/main/docs/assets/Picture2.png)

[Myers-Briggs test](https://github.com/DuploMinh/COSC2083-ASM2/blob/main/docs/assets/Picture3.png)

Here, I have included the results of 3 different online tests that I have completed. In the presented order, these are the learning style test, the Big-5 personality trait test, and the Myers-Briggs test. I don’t often choose my teammates based on the results of personality tests. This is due to the fact that some test such as the Myers-Briggs test have been criticized greatly for its lack of reliability and its lack of account for some complex personality type. But overall, if were I need to use personality tests, there are 3 factors that I use to choose my potential teammates: how they behave under pressure, how they are willing to accept new ideas, how do they act when they collaborate. So, I will mainly use the big 5 test for my choices as I believe the 5 aspects that the test measures will quantify the traits that I want my team mates to have. To find someone who is good at dealing with stress, I will look into the Neurotic quantity as it identify how one is going to react in stress. I will also investigate their Agreeableness and their openness quality to satisfy my next two requirements.
